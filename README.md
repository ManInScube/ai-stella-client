# STELLA AI Client

## This is the test task i've implemented. The task condition:
>Setup STELLA on your computer (simple tutorial in documentation https://docs.stellaframework.com/Getting_Started.html)
>Use Vue.js
>Make a Chat Feature: Your app should have a chat where users can easily send messages to Stella and get replies. Make sure the chat works without delay. STELLA uses Socket.io,
>meaning that's what you need to use too.

No styles were required, just functionality.
